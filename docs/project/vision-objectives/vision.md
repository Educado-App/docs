# Vision Document

## 1. Introduction

In modern educational environments, engaging and interactive learning experiences are essential. The increasing demand for accessible and personalized education has driven the need for platforms that leverage interactive content, gamification, and tailored user experiences.

This project addresses these challenges through the development and enhancement of the Educado app, incorporating interactive activities, gamified elements, and user-friendly interfaces designed for a wide audience.

The Educado Initiative is a global collaboration of students, educators, and tech enthusiasts creating free, easy-to-use educational tools. One of our key missions is to empower underserved communities, particularly waste pickers, through education. This aligns with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education.

The project's ongoing progress, updates, and technical documentation are openly accessible through the [Educado GitHub repository](https://github.com/Educado-App).

## 2. Vision Statement

The primary objective is to enhance the Educado app by integrating interactive learning activities, intuitive progress tracking, and engaging user experiences. This will significantly improve usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction, fostering continuous engagement and effective learning outcomes.

Additionally, the initiative aims to offer practical, relevant learning for marginalized groups. For example, waste pickers—often excluded from traditional education—gain access to content on finances, health, hygiene, and equipment operations through mobile-first experiences.

## 3. Objectives and Scope

### Objectives:
- Enhance user engagement through interactive video lessons with integrated quizzes and bonus-point systems.
- Improve user experience by redesigning progress tracking with a step-by-step progress bar.
- Implement clear, actionable feedback mechanisms and customizable alerts to encourage active participation.
- Optimize quiz interfaces for improved usability and clearer feedback presentation.
- Address specific learning needs of underserved communities such as waste pickers.

### Scope:
#### Included:
- Step-by-step progress bar to clearly visualize lesson completion.
- Interactive video lessons with embedded questions and adjustable playback speeds.
- Improved quiz interface with a “Submit Answer” button and clearer, intuitive explanations.
- Motivational and rewarding messages post-activity.
- Open-source repository for transparency and collaboration.
- Learning modules tailored for low-literacy users.

#### Not Included:
- Comprehensive backend architecture changes.
- Full redesign of all app interfaces (focus is on targeted usability improvements).
- Non-educational components or unrelated app functionality enhancements.
